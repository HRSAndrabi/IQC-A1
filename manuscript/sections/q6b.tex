\textbf{Problem 6b: Quantum circuit (5-qubit)}. Work out a 5-bit quantum implementation of $f(x)$ â€“ i.e. if there are more $1$'s than $0$'s in the input, your function should return $1$, otherwise returns $0$. 
Draw a schematic quantum circuit which demonstrates the working of this function. 
You do not need to draw the full quantum circuit, a clear strategy that demonstrates the working for 5-qubit inputs is sufficient. 
You must use only one, two and three-qubit gates. 
Hint: You may use your 3-bit implementation from part (a) as a black box.
