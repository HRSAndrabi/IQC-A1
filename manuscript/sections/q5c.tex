\textbf{Problem 5c: CHSH inequality (shared qubits)}. Now consider the case where Alice and Bob share the state (Alice qubit first, Bob qubit second): $\psi_{AB} = \cos(\phi)\ket{01} - \sin(\phi)\ket{10}$. 
For what values of $\psi$ is the quantity $\langle QS + RS + RT - QT\rangle$ maximum (given the observables in part (b))? 
What is the significance of such $\psi$ for the state $\ket{\psi_{AB}}$? 
How does this value for $\langle QS + RS + RT - QT\rangle$ compare to the value in part (a)? 
This is the basis of the CHSH inequality.
