\textbf{Problem 5a: CHSH inequality (classical states)}. Suppose that $Q, R, S$, and $T$ take values $\{\pm 1\}$. 
Consider the quantity composed of combined operators: $QS + RS + RT - QT$. 
Note that there is an implied tensor product in these combined operators.
In this case, what is the upper bound on the expectation (mean value) of the quantity $QS + RS + RT - QT$? 
This is called Bell's inequality.
