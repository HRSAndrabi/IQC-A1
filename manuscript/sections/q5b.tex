\textbf{Problem 5b: CHSH inequality (quantum states)}. Next we consider measuring the expectation value of the quantity $QS + RS + RT - QT$ when Alice and Bob have access to quantum states. 
What are the eigenvalues for each of $Q, R, S$, and $T$? 
What is the expectation value $\langle QS + RS + RT - QT \rangle$ for the product state $\ket{\psi_{\text{Alice}}} \otimes \ket{\psi_{\text{Bob}}}$? 
What is the max possible value?
