\textbf{Problem 1c: Rotations on the Quantum User Interface (QUI)}. In the QUI, consider a rotation around the $(1,1,0)$-axis by $\pi/2$ with global phase set to $0$. 
Use the QUI to perform the rotation to the computational states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ individually and hence determine the 2x2 matrix representation for this rotation. 
Submit appropriate screenshots with your answers. 
Explain quantitatively (using diagrams) how the operation moves the state on the Bloch Sphere.
