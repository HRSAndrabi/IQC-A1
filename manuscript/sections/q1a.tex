\textbf{Problem 1a: Bloch sphere form}. Consider the following single qubit state $\ket{\psi} = a_0\ket{0} + a_1\ket{1}$ where the amplitudes are given in polar form as: $(|a_0| = 0.383, \theta_0 = \pi)$ and $(|a_1| = 0.924, \theta_0 = -\pi /2)$ 
As per the definition given in the lectures, convert to Bloch sphere form specifying the Bloch angles $\theta_B$ and $\phi_B$. Plot on the Bloch sphere.
