\textbf{Problem 6a: Quantum circuit (3-qubit)}. Design a quantum circuit that implements $f(x)$ for $x$ represented by $n=3$ qubits (in ket notation, define the left-most qubit corresponding to the most significant bit). 
Draw the quantum circuit using one-qubit gates, two-qubit gates and as few Toffoli gates as possible. 
Explain its working. 
You may use ancilla qubits.
